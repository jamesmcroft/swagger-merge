The Swagger Merge CLI tool allows you to process the merging of multiple Swagger files into a single Swagger file. This is useful for bringing together the API layer of a distributed service architecture where you wish to expose the APIs via a single API gateway.

The CLI tool currently supports merging Swagger V2 specification JSON files. It is not yet capable of merging Swagger V3 specification JSON or YAML files.

This tool uses the Swagger Merge SDK which is available as [a NuGet package for you to use in your own applications for merging Swagger files](https://www.nuget.org/packages/SwaggerMerge.SDK/).

## Getting started

### Install the tool

```bash
dotnet tool install -g SwaggerMerge
```

**Or update an existing install**

```bash
dotnet tool update -g SwaggerMerge
```

### Configure your Swagger document merge

To use the CLI tool, you will need access to all of your Swagger v2 JSON input files, and you will need to create a configuration JSON file that will be used by the CLI tool to determine how to merge the input files together.

Here's an example of the format for this configuration file.

```json
{
  "inputs": [
      {
          "file": "./projects.swagger.json"
      },
      {
          "file": "./users.swagger.json",
          "path": {
              "prepend": "/api/users",
              "stripStart": "/foo",
          },
          "info": {
              "append": true,
              "title": " Including Users",
          }
      }
  ],
  "output": {
      "file": "./api.swagger.json",
      "info": {
          "title": "Services",
          "version": "1.0"
      },
      "basePath": "/",
      "host": "localhost:8080",
      "schemes": [
          "https"
      ],
      "securityDefinitions": {
          "ApiKeyAuth": {
              "type": "apiKey",
              "in": "header",
              "name": "Authorization"
          }
      },
      "security": [
          {
              "ApiKeyAuth": []
          }
      ]  
  }
}
```

The configuration file is made up of several options that allow you to customize and tailor the inputs and output of the tool.

- `inputs` - **Required**. An array of input files. Each input file is a JSON object with the following properties:
  - `file` - **Required**. The path to the input file.
  - `path` - **Optional**. A configuration object for the paths of APIs with the following properties:
    - `prepend` - **Optional**. A string to prepend to the path of each operation in the input file.
    - `stripStart` - **Optional**. A string to strip from the start of the path of each operation in the input file.
  - `info` - **Optional**. A configuration object for the info section with the following properties:
    - `append` - **Optional**. A boolean value that determines whether the input file's info title should be appended to the output file's info title.
    - `title` - **Optional**. A string to use as the title of the output file that is different to the original.
- `output` - **Required**. A configuration object for the output file with the following properties:
  - `file` - **Required**. The path to the output file.
  - `info` - **Optional**. A configuration object for the info section with the following properties:
    - `title` - **Optional**. A string to use as the title of the output file.
    - `version` - **Optional**. A string to use as the version of the output file.
  - `basePath` - **Optional**. A string to use as the base path of the output file.
  - `host` - **Optional**. A string to use as the host of the output file.
  - `schemes` - **Optional**. An array of strings to use as the schemes of the output file.
  - `securityDefinitions` - **Optional**. A configuration object for the security definitions of the output file with the following properties:
    - `type` - **Optional**. A string to use as the type of the security definition.
    - `in` - **Optional**. A string to use as the in of the security definition.
    - `name` - **Optional**. A string to use as the name of the security definition.
  - `security` - **Optional**. An array of security requirements to use in the output file.

### Run the merge tool

Once you have your configuration file, it is simply a case of running CLI and passing the file as the first argument to the tool.

```bash
swagger-merge -c config.json
```

This will merge all of the input files into a single output file at the configured path. And that's it!
